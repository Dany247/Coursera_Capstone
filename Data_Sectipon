We have a data set from the Seattle Police Department with a history of more than 15 years.

In an effort to reduce the frequency of car collisions in a community, an algorithm must be 
developed to predict the severity of an accident given the weather conditions, road and visibility conditions.
A model will be made that can predict severity based on indpendent variables.
