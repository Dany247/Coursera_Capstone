# Coursera_Capstone
This project will contain work towards a part of a certification in completion of Capstone Project.
I am using a collision data provided by US traffic board 

Major Problems that will be solved using this data:

Which section of the automobile should be focussed to improve safety in automobiles so that collision can be prevented?
What type of collisions are frequent and of what severity?
What and when the changes should be made in relation to infrastructure development?  
In what type of weather conditions maximum collisions have been recorded?
Were Speeding and weather factors of collision?
Which severity was at peak at different weather conditions?
What are the major reasons behind collision?

Target audience:- 
Automobile companies: Automobile companies can use the results to identify opportunity to develop vehicle technology to prevent collisions 
General Insurance companies: Insurance companies can mpodify its underwriting rules and make changes in product norms or make excluions on the basis of data of maximum collisions 
Traffic/Transportation ministry: Road Transport ministry can focus more on reasons of collision and importance of road maintenence

Why these sector companies should care about your problem?
To increase their sales revenue by building a more sophisticated and top notch in safety product
By reducing risk and claims as much as possible and earn more profits
In order to show the better results to the general publc by decreasing collision in no.s in coming years
